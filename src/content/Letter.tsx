    lead="Not in Our Honor is a coalition of local Native American leaders and American Indian organizations in the Kansas City metropolitan area who have been speaking out against the use of Native American stereotypes and misappropriation of Native American culture for many years.">
    <p>
      The decision of the Kansas City football team to prohibit fans from
      wearing “headdresses and face paint styled in a way that references or
      appropriates American Indian cultures and traditions,” this season is a
      step in the right direction. While it may address the more blatant racist
      behaviors in the stadium, it does not address the overall racism and
      appropriation of Native culture inherent with utilizing a race of People
      as a mascot. It is also a disservice to the fans. While misguided at best,
      the fans are trying to support their team.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        By identifying some behaviors as too “offensive” while reserving some
        behaviors (tomahawk chop) for review, the team not only robs fans of the
        full fan experience, they have made the determination that some racism
        is okay, but blatant racism is not.
      </strong>{' '}
      This is directly in opposition to the recent statements made by the NFL,
      team owners, management, and players about social justice.
    </p>

    <h2>There is no honor in imagery of "The Chief"</h2>

    <p>
      Additionally, banning these behaviors is unlikely to stop devout fans from
      continuing to don headdresses and face paint in the parking lot, nor will
      it prevent the opposing team from racist behavior. The opposing team will
      still use the same offensive signs and verbiage they have used for many
      years, such as, “send them back to the reservation,” “scalp them,” and
      “Trail of Tears.”

      The Kansas City’s team name was chosen in 1963 to honor a mayor nicknamed
      “The Chief” due to his founding of an imaginary Boy Scout Indian tribe.
      This occurred before the Civil Rights movement and before the American
      Indian Civil Rights movement in the 1970s. For decades, hundreds of
      tribes, national Indian organizations, and professional organizations have
      spoken out on this matter. In 2005, the APA called for the immediate
      retirement of all American Indian mascots, symbols, images and
      personalities by schools, colleges, universities, athletic teams and
      organizations, stating:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Research has shown that the continued use of American Indian mascots,
        symbols, images and personalities has a negative effect on not only
        American Indian students but all students...
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The attempt to justify the maintenance of racist mascots because a very
      small number of Native Americans accept it, when a majority of us
      vehemently oppose them is shocking. A recent study found the more
      connected the individual Native is with their culture (language,
      traditions, ceremonies), the stronger their opposition.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, with the NFL also stating they will be stenciling in “End Racism”
      and “It Takes All of Us” in the endzones, we call on the Kansas City team
      to:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cease the use of racialized Native American branding by eliminating all
        imagery of or evocative of Native American culture, traditions, and
        spirituality from their team franchise by changing the name including
        the logo. This includes the use of Native terms, drum, arrows, or
        monikers that assume the presence of Native American culture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Apply the NFL’s “zero tolerance” for on-field use of racial and
        homophobic slurs to all races and ethnic groups, especially Native
        Peoples.
      </li>
    </ol>
